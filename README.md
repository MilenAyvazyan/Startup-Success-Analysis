# Startup-Success-Analysis
Exploratory Analysis of Factors Influencing Startup Success or Failure.
# Overview
This project explores the factors that impact the success or failure of startups through a combination of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling. The dataset includes various attributes from 472 startup companies.

## Features

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Addressing invalid or incorrect values and converting columns to appropriate data types.
- Managing missing data by removing columns with too many missing values and imputing others based on their distribution.
- Encoding categorical variables for use in analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Performing distribution analysis to understand the spread of key features.
- Using techniques like Gradient Boosting to identify the most influential factors for startup success.
- Visualizing relationships through histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.

## Conclusion
This project combines data cleaning, EDA, and predictive modeling to identify key patterns and insights related to startup success. It provides a complete walkthrough of the process, including methodology, code, and results.
